This web application was designed to allow employees to post and trade shifts with each other. 

Upon logging in (required for all users to be able to view anything but the landing page), the administrator is able to view all posts, and delete them as needed. Non-admin users are unable to delete entries, and only see non-expired posts.
Users can view all current posts, and may search for particular dates, times, etc. to pick up a shift. They may also create a new post by filling out a form. The data from the form is added to the database upon being submitted, and an email is started with the necessary information filled in automatically.
